# Denoising Images using Deep CNN Autoencoder

## Overview
This project focuses on denoising images using a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Autoencoder. The goal is to develop a robust solution capable of removing noise from images while preserving essential visual details. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset but can be adapted for denoising images from various domains.

## Features
- Utilizes a CNN Autoencoder architecture optimized for image denoising tasks.
- Incorporates Gaussian noise to simulate real-world noise conditions in images.
- Provides both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations for evaluating denoising performance.
- Potential applications include medical imaging, surveillance, and remote sensing.
